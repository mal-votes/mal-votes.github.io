# Using Remind Command
Use the `/remind` command to set reminders for people and in channels. 

You can also use `/remind list` to see and delete reminders you have already set up. To change a reminder, you must delete and recreate it.

General syntax:
`/remind (#channel or @person) [to] (what to do) (when to do it)

If you don't like live-entering commands like `/remind`, you can instead edit it on a text editor and copy/paste to your Slack input area from there.

Also if you want to practice, go into your self channel (for @kalessin, it's the DM with kalessin) and go nuts, reminding yourself with all sorts of things. When you're comfortable with it, you can switch your self tag with the appropriate channel name.

E.g. for @kalessin, practice with:
`/remind @kalessin do something every thursday, friday, and sunday at 1 PM PT`

Then to take to #unlearn-racism:
`/remind #unlearn-racism do something every thursday, friday, and sunday at 1 PM PT`

Remember to use `/remind list` periodically to make sure you don't have any unintended reminders running. From that Slackbot response, you can delete reminders you no longer want.

(Note: for copy/pasting directly from this document to Slack, be aware that the marked up text won't work properly with Slack. You need to copy/paste through an intermediary text editor to get the formatting out of the string so the command will work properly.)
