# Using Remind Command
Use the `/remind` command to set reminders for people and in channels. You can also use `/remind list` to see and delete reminders you have already set up. To change a reminder, you must delete and recreate it.

If you don't like live-entering commands like `/remind`, you can instead edit it on a text editor and copy/paste to your Slack input area from there.
