### Party: Democratic
If you're a Republican, g-d help you. But I wouldn't vote for him. (Evergreen remarrk here.)<br />
<br />
In general you'll see me vote democrat, green, socialist, or independent. I tend to vote/believe in tax-and-spend democrat ways. If I had my ideal, I would be able to practice outright socialism.<br />

### President of the US
* Presidential Preference: ✔️ Kamala Harris<br />Very much holding my nose here. She's promised to continue supporting genocide in Gaza, but better than the GOP's feral candidate who wants to end voting. I feel like I otherwise agree or can tolerate her policies. Part of it is because I feel like I understand her a little better than I did Biden, but parasocial relationships have led us down some bad roads before. She won't end voting though, or further dismantle already in-peril social services that I and my loved ones rely on or will rely on, so still better than the other guy. And if the other guy wins, god help me. I guess we'll see if I survive. Though I've survived this shit before.<br />

### Federal
#### United States Senator
Full Term Senator: ✔️ Adam Schiff, Democrat. Not much else to recommend him.<br />
<br />
