## Notes and Recommendations
Information and recommendations and general guides sparse this election. Not sure why. I did get a Labor (Alameda Labor Council AFL-CIO) mailer, but aside from that, just got spammed about single measures and single candidates. Berkeley Mayor seems to be running a smear campaign against at least one opponent, classy.

### Party: Democratic
If you're a Republican, g-d help you. But I wouldn't vote for him.

### President of the US
* Presidential Preference: ✔️ Joseph R. Biden Jr.<br />Very much holding my nose here. He's a pro-genocide fucker, but better than the GPO's feral candidate who wants to end voting. Barely.

### Democratic Central Committee, 14th Assembly District
Going with the [Climate Labor Progressives'](https://www.climatelaborprogressives.com/) slate, per [The Berkeley Scanner](https://www.berkeleyscanner.com/2024/02/02/deep-dives/2024-election-guide-berkeley-alameda-county/).
* ✔️ Michael Barnett
* ✔️ Wendy Bloom
* ✔️ Julie Caskey
* ✔️ Elizabeth Echols
* ✔️ Sarah Price
* ✔️ Igor Tregub
* ✔️ Ana Vasudeo 

### Federal
#### United States Senator, Full Term
* ✔️ Barbara Lee<br />One of the first to demand cease fire in Palestine. Yes, I'm willing to make this a single issue vote.

#### United Sates Senator, Partial Term
* ✔️ Barbara Lee<br />She's also served in Congress since 1998.

#### Congress
* District 12: ✔️ Lateefah Simon

### California
* 7th State Senate District: :heavy_check_mark: Kathryn Lybarger (object of smear campaign by Jessie Arreguin, who was kind of a weasel as Berkeley Mayor IMHO).
* 14th State Assembly District: :heavy_check_mark: Buffy Wicks

### Nonpartisan
* Superior Court Judge, Office #5: :heavy_check_mark: Terry Wiley
* Superior Court Judge, Office #12: I asked a friend about this one - they each have sort of obvious pluses and minuses in terms of experience and role, weird endorsements splits. Not sure about this one.
* Supervisor, 5th District: :heavy_check_mark: Nikki Fortunato Bas

### State Measures
* 1: **Yes**, with reservations. Some campaigners say it just diverts money that is already being used for other mental health services.

### County Measures
* A: **Yes**, I am for making government and civil service processes faster, to a point, at least. 14 days seems sufficient.
* B: **Yes**, opponents listed on the ballot concern me.

### School Measure
* H: **Yes**, I even have a front yard sign! I'm a tax-and-spend Democrat, happy to pay my share of taxes for good social programs, including education.
