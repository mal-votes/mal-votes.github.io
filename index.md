* Senate California: :white_check_mark: **Alex Padilla** (incumbent, Democrat)<br />Endorsed by: Farmworkers, LiUNA, IATSE (theater), NNU & CNA (nurses), CFT (teachers)

### California
* Governor: :white_check_mark: **Gavin Newsom** (incumbent, Democrat)<br />Endorsed by: CTA & CFT (teachers), Labor, some voters, but also took Doordash, Dreamworks, & AirBNB, but at least he's not Republican! (I'm not pleased but he's better than the alternative).
* Lt. Governor: :white_check_mark: **Eleni Kounalakis** (incumbent, Democrat)<br />Endorsed by: CTA (teachers), SEI (service), CLF (labor). Her contributors are quite a bit better than Newsome's. Still, better than a republican.
* AG: :white_check_mark: **Rob Bonta** (incumbent, Democrat)<br />Endorsed by: CLF (labor), CTA & CFT (teachers), SEI (service), CNA (nurses). Campaign money from PACs, businesses, trade unions, incl lots of SEIU chapters.
* Sec of State: :white_check_mark: **Shirley Weber** (incumbent, Democrat)<br />Endorsed by: CTA & CFT (teachers), CNA (nurses), SEI (service), CLF (labor). Contributions look okay. 
* Treasurer: :white_check_mark: **Fiona Ma** (incumbent, Democrat)<br />Endorsed by: CTA & CFT (teachers), SEI (service), CLF (labor). Contributions largely from unions, retirees. Red flag: Peace Officers Research Association of California (PORAC) contributor. If ACAB, then what are these folks up to?

Contributions are smaller donations from many trade unions. Compare to Christensen's endorsements and contributions. Thurmond isn't declare democrat but has democrat endorsements.
* Commissioner of Insurance: :white_check_mark: **Ricardo Lara** (incumbent, Democrat)<br />Endorsed by: Gavin Newsome, Alex Padilla, CTA & CFT (teachers), SEIU (service), CNA (nurses), CLF (labor).

* California Supreme Court (Liu's seat): :white_check_mark: **Goodwin Liu** (incumbent)<br />Socially liberal, filibustered by Republicans. [LA Times](https://www.latimes.com/local/la-xpm-2011-jul-27-la-me-0727-goodwin-liu-20110727-story.html) (2011). Retain.

### Propositions
([ref](https://www.sos.ca.gov/administration/news-releases-and-advisories/2022-news-releases-and-advisories/proposition-numbers), [ref2](https://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/ballot-measures/qualified-ballot-measures))
* 1: Right to Reproductive Freedom Amendment (2022) - :white_check_mark: **YES**. <br />The con argument that it will allow abortion at any time is why I support it.
* 26: Legalize Sports Betting on American Indian Lands Initiative (2022) - :white_check_mark: **YES**. <br />Of the two similar Proposals, this one is supported by more, smaller tribes (in coalition) that don't have casinos of their own, and would work against big, out-of-state investors.
* 27: Legalize Sports Betting and Revenue for Homelessness Prevention Fund Initiative (2022) - :x: **NO**. <br />Lots of big ad dollars for this, only a few big tribes and lots of out of state money to promote it.
* 28: Art and Music K-12 Education Funding Initiative (2022) - :white_check_mark: **YES**. <br />Arts and music education is vital to our culture, literacy, and democracy.
* 29: Dialysis Clinic Requirements Initiative (2022) - :x: **NO**. <br />DaVita funded $52M of the $86M funding against. Asking around. But the marketing is similar to how Uber and Door Dash pushed the gig economy proposition in California in previous elections. The commercial features "dialysis patients" but you can't find that in the fundraising. That said, I spoke with a friend who's a dialysis patient, and he says vote NO, so NO it is.
* 30: Tax on Income Above $2 Million for Zero Emissions Vehicles and Wildfire Prevention Initiative (2022) - :white_check_mark: **YES**. <br />Almost always vote pro-climate. And tax/eat the rich. I honestly don't care if it drives people away. If they don't want to pay taxes, they shouldn't live here and probably aren't contributing as much as they say they are.
* 31: Flavored Tobacco Products Ban Referendum (2022) - :white_check_mark: **YES**. <br />Flavored tobacco is the tobacco industry's newest ploy to market to kids. Tobacco causes cancer. Cancer sucks. Have them sell their death product where the government doesn't care about its people.

### Measures
* Alameda County Measure D: Floor Area Ratio Measure (November 2022) - :white_check_mark: **YES**.
* Berkeley Measure L: Housing and Infrastructure Bond Measure (November 2022) - :white_check_mark: **YES**. <br />Always vote YES on bond measures for Berkeley.
* Berkeley Measure M: Vacant Residential Property Tax Measure (November 2022) - :white_check_mark: **YES**. <br />Increase incentives for landlords to make housing more available, and reduce housing stock for AirBnB and other short-stay rental properties.
* Berkeley Measure N: Low-Rent Housing Measure (November 2022) - :white_check_mark: **YES**. <br />Low rent housing, please!
