### November 2020 Voting Guide and Recommendations
In order listed by ballot.
#### Federal
* **President: Biden/Harris** Biden has problems. Harris has problems. But they're the best choice we have in the face of the DEVIL INCARNATE. So **VOTE FOR THEM NONETHELESS!!!**
* **House: Barbara Lee** She's many times incumbent and is probably too comfortable, but the only alternative for me is write-ins.

#### California
* **Senate District 9: Skinner** Skinner has made a lot of enemies but also has a lot of Union and teacher support. Hold nose. Vote.
* **Assembly District 15: Wicks or Brink** Some say Wicks takes dirty money, but she also has support from Sierra Club and Unions. Brink states no party affiliation.
* **Superior Court Judge Office #2: Elena Condes** Experienced, wide endorsements.

#### Berkeley
* Some are multi-choice or ranked choice. Full slate for each is recommended.
** How [Ranked Choice Voting Works](https://www.acgov.org/rov/rcv/faq.htm).
* **Rent Stabilization Board, Multichoice (5): Simon-Weisberg, Mendonca, Kelley, Walker, Johnson** Sierra Club and East Bay for Everyone endorsements.
* **School Director, BUSD: Babbit, Chang** Babbit is a Black woman. Chang has key endorsements, among them, Mayor Jesse, who is not my favorite, but my hope is it indicates Chang is influential enough to get endorsements.

#### Alameda County
* **Transit At-Large: Victoria Fierce** Yar: "I'll always side-eye her housing politics & history with SFBARF/YIMBY but this might be a good fit for her. Dollene Jones would be my first choice if she championed free rides the way Fierce does.""
* **Transit Ward 1: Jovanka D. Beckles** Good endorsements.

#### East Bay / Regional
* **BART District 7: Lateefah Simon** BART Police are so afraid of this blind black incumbent, they send her death threats and are running their own candidate (Kidd) to represent cops. Anyone the cops hate is pretty much a friend of ours.
* **EBRP Ward 1: Echols** La Force is problematic, and Echols has some good backers.

#### California
* **Prop 14: YES** The downside is that it adds to state debt without providing for funding, but it's funding research, which I tend to favor.
* **Prop 15: YES** Large commercial properties should pay taxes. Provides funds for schools.
* **Prop 16: YES** Legalize affirmative action.
* **Prop 17: YES** Let ex-cons vote.
* **Prop 18: YES** Let 17 going on 18 year olds vote in primaries.
* **Prop 19: YES** May help olds and folks dealing with disasters.
* **Prop 20: NO** Longer prison sentences. NOPE.
* **Prop 21: YES** Legalize rent control.
* **Prop 22: NO** Uber, Lyft & Doordash just want to keep exploiting their workers. They got MADD's endorsement, which sucks for us. But NO.
* **Prop 23: NO** Yar: "I'm loathe to side with bosses over unions, but must accept that in this case, the prop is a bullshit sideshow which would be bad for patients. [source](https://www.rsnhope.org/rsn-blog/no-pro-23/) [2](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/02/health/kidney-dialysis-kickbacks.html) [3](https://www.cmadocs.org/newsroom/news/view/ArticleId/38532/CMA-Board-of-Trustees-votes-to-oppose-dialysis-ballot-initiative)" We also have friends in California on Dialysis who also say emphatically NO. Even an ex-SEIU member (the main union pro-23).
* **Prop 24: NO** Pretends to be pro-privacy, but waters down privacy laws.
* **Prop 25: YES** Gets rid of money bail, which may be a great improvement. But assessment system may suck, and we don't know yet.

#### Alameda County
* **Measure V: YES** I always vote for higher taxes.
* **Measure W: YES** I alwyas vote for higher taxes.

#### Berkeley
* Some are multi-choice or ranked choice. Full slate for each is recommended.
 * How [Ranked Choice Voting Works](https://www.acgov.org/rov/rcv/faq.htm).
* **Measure FF: YES** East Bay for Everyone. $0.10/sq foot tax for improvements to fund emergency services $8.5M/year.
* **Measure GG: YES** East Bay for Everyone and Sierra Club. Tax on rideshare services to fund Berkeley municipal services.
* **Measure HH: YES** Sierra Club. Increase tax on utilities with exemptions for Berkeley municpal services.
* **Measure II: YES** East Bay for Everyone and Sierra Club. Police Accountability.
* **Measure JJ: YES** Salary amendments for mayor and councilmembers.
* **Measure KK: idk** Strike residency requirement for sworn fire department members.
* **Measure LL: YES** Allows Berkeley to continue spending funds generated by taxes for FY2021 - FT 2024.
* **Measure MM: YES** East Bay for Everyone and Sierra Club. Rent stabilization.
* **Mayor: Ranked: First choice: Hsiung, Second Choice: Arreguin** Arreguin will probably win, but I want to give Hsiung, whose proposed policies are much better in my opinion, _something_.
* **City Council, District 3: Ranked: First choice: Matthews, Second choice: Martinez** Almost arbitrary choice. I think Bartlett is lazy. Matthews is a Black woman. Martinez is a Latino man.
